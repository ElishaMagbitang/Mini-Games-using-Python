2. **📊 Dashboard** – A simple interactive menu/dashboard to access and launch the games.
3. **❓ Guessing Game** – Try to guess the secret number with hints of "higher" or "lower".
4. **📝 Quiz Game** – Answer multiple-choice or true/false questions and test your knowledge.
5. **🐍 Snake** – The classic snake game where the snake grows as it eats food.
6. **⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe** – The classic two-player "X and O" game on a 3x3 board.
